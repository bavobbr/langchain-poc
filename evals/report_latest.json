(Rule 13.2 f)\n\n**Exceptions:**\n\n*   **Free Hit Taken Immediately (Within 5 meters of the circle):** If the free hit is taken immediately, defenders who are inside the circle within 5 meters of the free hit may shadow around the inside of the circle a player who takes a self-pass, provided that they do not play or attempt to play the ball or influence play until it has either traveled at least 5 meters or alternatively been touched by a defending player who can legitimately play the ball. (Rule 13.2 f)\n*   **Defending Player Touches the Ball:** After a defending player has touched the ball, it can be played into the circle by any other player, including the player who took the free hit. (Rule 13.2 f)\n\n**Important Considerations:**\n\n*   **Player Positioning:** All players other than the player taking the free hit must be at least 5 meters from the ball. (Rule 13.2 c)\n*   **Free Hit Procedures Apply:** The procedures for taking a free hit apply to this situation. (Rule 13.2)\n*   **Raising the Ball:** The ball may be raised immediately using a push, flick, or scoop but must not be raised intentionally using a hit. (Rule 13.2 d, e)\n*   **Dangerous Play:** Any action that is deemed dangerous, such as a flick or scoop towards an opponent within 5 meters, should be penalized. (Rule 9.9)\n\n**In summary:** The key is the 5-meter rule. The ball must travel 5 meters or be touched by a defender before it can be played into the circle. The exception is when the free hit is taken immediately and defenders are shadowing.\n",

This suggests a continuation of play even after the official time has expired for specific situations.\n*   **Penalty Corner Rules:** The rules regarding penalty corners (Rule 13.3) and when they are no longer applicable (Rule 13.5) imply a sequence of actions that must be completed without significant interruption.\n*   **Goalkeepers:** Goalkeepers are allowed to use their equipment to stop the ball (Rule 10.2), which implies a continuous defensive action.\n*   **Umpires' Responsibility:** Umpires are responsible for ensuring that the full time is played and for indicating the end of time for each quarter and for the completion of a penalty corner if a quarter is prolonged (Rule 11.5). This highlights the importance of managing the flow of play.\n\nTherefore, \"continuous\" in indoor hockey, in the context of the provided rules, likely refers to the uninterrupted flow of play, especially during penalty corners and penalty strokes, and the umpire's role in managing the game's duration.\n",

(Rule 13.2)\n\n**Other Considerations:**\n\n*   **Distance of Opponents:** All players other than the player taking the free hit must be at least 5 meters from the ball. (Rule 13.2 c) If an opponent is within 5 meters of the ball, they must not interfere with the taking of the free hit or must not play or attempt to play the ball. (Rule 13.2 b)\n*   **Raising the Ball:** The ball may be raised immediately using a push, flick, or scoop, but must not be raised intentionally using a hit. (Rule 13.2 d, e)\n*   **Multiple Touches:** If the player taking the free hit continues to play the ball (i.e., no defending player has yet touched it), that player may play the ball any number of times, but the ball must travel at least 5 meters before that player plays the ball into the circle by hitting or pushing the ball again.
